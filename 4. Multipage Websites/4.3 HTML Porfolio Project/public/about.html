<h1>About Me</h1>

  Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is <b>Naveen Sharma</b>, and I am
  currently pursuing a B.Tech in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) from the
  University School of Automation and Robotics (USAR), Delhi. I am part of the
  IIoT batch of 2022-2026, where I am gaining comprehensive knowledge and skills
  in this rapidly growing field.

<p>
  With a strong passion for technology and a keen interest in the intersection
  of automation, robotics, and the internet, I am dedicated to exploring the
  potential of IIoT and leveraging its transformative power. Throughout my
  academic journey, I am actively engaged in learning and implementing
  cutting-edge technologies to develop innovative solutions for real-world
  challenges.

  In addition to my focus on IIoT, I am also honing my software development
  skills, particularly in Java and web development. Java, known for its
  versatility and robustness, is an integral part of my programming
  toolkit.Furthermore, my knowledge of web development technologies, including
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enables me to design captivating user interfaces
  and develop interactive web applications. I believe that effective user
