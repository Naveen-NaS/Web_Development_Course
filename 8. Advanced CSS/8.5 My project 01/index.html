      <h2>Shloka 1:</h2>
      <p>
        Vrindavana dhäma is non-different from Krishna because the name, form,
        fame, and place where the Lord manifests - are all identical with the
        Lord as absolute knowledge. Therefore, Vrindavana dhäma is as
        worshipable as the Lord.

      <h2>Shloka 2:</h2>
      <p>
        The banks of Yamuna river, peacocks and beautiful temples make Vrindavan
        the most wonderful place in the world. You will see devotees sitting in
        front of Krishna deity chanting and singing Krishna bhajans. The
        devotion of devotees in Vrindavan is ineffable.
